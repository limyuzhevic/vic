## Phase 6 — Current Focus: FINAL INTEGRATION

**Status**: IN PROGRESS (~36% complete)

**Phase 6 is the integration phase** that connects all existing systems (1-5) into a coherent artificial brain. The architecture exists but most cognitive systems remain disconnected from the main brain loop.

### Current Goals
- Connect WorkingMemory to sensory processing
- Connect EpisodicMemory to experience logging
- Connect PredictionSystem to sensory processing
- Connect NeuralPlanner to action selection
- Connect ConceptFormation to experience processing

### What Needs Integration
- Working memory is defined but not connected to sensory processing
- Episodic memory is never updated with experiences
- No replay mechanism
- No sleep/consolidation
- Neural planner exists but is never called
- Concept formation exists but never processes experiences
- Self-model exists but never updates
- Social learning exists but never observes
- Dopamine only modulates STDP weights
- Other neuromodulators (ACh, NE, 5-HT) are stubs
- No connection between neuromodulation and memory
- No connection between neuromodulation and attention
- Prediction system exists but is never trained
- Prediction error is computed but doesn't update predictions
- No use of predictions for attention or planning
- CheckpointSystem is implemented but not connected
- Brain save/load are stubs
- No life history tracking

- Calcium-based plasticity mechanisms
- Glial cell interactions
- Anatomically constrained connectivity
- Reinforcement learning integration
- Hierarchical planning structures

## Anti-Transformer Reminder

Throughout all phases, NLM must NEVER become:
- A transformer architecture
- An LLM
- A pretrained model
- A conventional deep learning system
- "LLM + memory"
- "LLM + tools"

The architecture must always be based on:
- Individual neurons
- Synapses
- Spike-based communication
- Neural plasticity
- Developmental processes

If at any point the architecture begins to resemble a transformer, it should be redirected or the project renamed to clarify it is no longer NLM.
