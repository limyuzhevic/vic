# NLM / 熙然 - Phase 6 Final Audit

**Date:** 2026-09-05
**Phase:** 6 - Final Integration, Maturation & Artificial Brain

---

## Executive Summary

The NLM/熙然 codebase contains a sophisticated architecture with many well-designed components, but **most cognitive systems are disconnected from the main brain loop**. The code has extensive "TODO PHASE 2" comments indicating systems were designed but not integrated.

**Key Finding:** The brain has the *anatomy* of a cognitive system but lacks the *integration* that makes it function as a coherent artificial brain.

**Location:** `src/brain/Brain.hpp`, `src/brain/Brain.cpp`

| Component | Status | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| LIF Neuron dynamics | ✅ WORKING | Event-driven spike processing |
| Synaptic transmission | ✅ WORKING | With delays, excitatory/inhibitory |
| Spike propagation | ✅ WORKING | Delayed spike events |
| STDP plasticity | ✅ WORKING | Applied each step |
| Hebbian plasticity | ✅ WORKING | Available |
| Structural plasticity | ✅ WORKING | Synaptogenesis/pruning every 100 steps |
| Working memory | ❌ DISCONNECTED | Returns nullptr |
| Episodic memory | ❌ DISCONNECTED | Returns nullptr |
| Semantic memory | ❌ DISCONNECTED | Returns nullptr |
| Procedural memory | ❌ DISCONNECTED | Returns nullptr |
| Prediction system | ❌ DISCONNECTED | Returns nullptr |

**Critical Issues:**
```cpp
// Brain.cpp lines 602-616
class WorkingMemory* Brain::getWorkingMemory() { return nullptr; }
class EpisodicMemory* Brain::getEpisodicMemory() { return nullptr; }
class SemanticMemory* Brain::getSemanticMemory() { return nullptr; }
class ProceduralMemory* Brain::getProceduralMemory() { return nullptr; }

// Brain.cpp lines 634-636
PredictionSystem* Brain::getPredictionSystem() { return nullptr; }

// Brain.cpp lines 497-505
bool Brain::save(const std::string& filepath) const {
    NLM_LOG_INFO("Saving brain state to " + filepath + " (not implemented)");
    return false;
}
bool Brain::load(const std::string& filepath) {
    NLM_LOG_INFO("Loading brain state from " + filepath + " (not implemented)");
    return false;
}
```

### 1.2 Agent Brain (Integration Layer) - STATUS: PARTIALLY INTEGRATED

- Reward modulation directly accesses synapses but doesn't integrate with memory

### 1.3 Memory Systems - STATUS: PARTIALLY INTEGRATED

**Location:** `src/memory/Memory.hpp`, `src/memory/NeuralWorkingMemory.hpp`

| Memory Type | Header Status | Implementation Status | Integration |
|-------------|--------------|----------------------|-------------|
| Working Memory | ✅ Defined | ⚠️ Partial (NeuralWorkingMemory exists) | ✅ **INTEGRATED** |
| Episodic Memory | ✅ Defined | ⚠️ Basic struct only | ✅ **INTEGRATED** |
| Semantic Memory | ✅ Defined | ❌ Empty implementation | ❌ Not used |
| Procedural Memory | ✅ Defined | ❌ Empty implementation | ❌ Not used |
| Associative Memory | ✅ Defined | ❌ Empty implementation | ❌ Not used |
| Attentional Selection | ✅ Defined | ⚠️ Partial | ✅ **INTEGRATED** |

**NeuralWorkingMemory Integration:**

- ✅ Part of the complete Phase 6 brain loop

**What's Still Missing:**
- Semantic Memory (empty implementation)
- Procedural Memory (empty implementation) 
- Associative Memory (empty implementation)
- Episodic Memory actual implementation (only basic struct)

**What's Working:**
- Working memory with persistent activity, competition, maintenance
- Episodic memory storage and basic retrieval
- Attentional selection with competition
- Memory integration into brain loop

### 1.4 Neuromodulation - STATUS: PARTIAL INTEGRATION

**Location:** `src/neuromodulation/`

| Norepinephrine | ⚠️ Stub | ❌ Not integrated |
| Acetylcholine | ⚠️ Stub | ❌ Not integrated |
| Curiosity | ✅ Working | ✅ Integrated into AgentBrain |

- No connection between dopamine and memory consolidation
- No connection between ACh and attention
- No connection between NE and arousal

**What's Still Missing:**
- ❌ None of these cognitive systems are actually USED in the brain loop
- ❌ NeuralPlanner never called for action planning
- ❌ ConceptFormation never processes experiences
- ❌ Self-model never updates
- ❌ Social learning never observes
- ❌ Spatial/temporal representation never activated

**Critical Finding:** These systems are fully implemented with proper neural mechanisms but are NEVER INSTANTIATED or USED anywhere in the brain or agent.

### 1.6 Prediction System - STATUS: PARTIALLY INSTANTIATED BUT UNCONNECTED

**What's Still Missing:**
- ❌ PredictionSystem never UPDATED in brain loop
- ❌ Prediction never USED for attention or planning
- ❌ Prediction errors don't drive learning
- ❌ Predictions never guide action selection

**Critical Gap:** Prediction system is anatomically present but disconnected functionally.

- Synaptogenesis and pruning are applied every 100 steps (lines 536-538)
- Development stages affect structural plasticity rates
- Maturation effects are applied

**What's Still Missing:**
- ❌ Development doesn't affect neural excitability
- ❌ Development doesn't affect plasticity rules themselves
- ❌ Development doesn't affect attention
- ❌ Development doesn't affect memory consolidation
- ❌ Development doesn't affect neuromodulation levels

**Critical Gap:** Development system has limited integration scope.

## 3. Main Brain Loop Analysis

**Current Brain::step() execution (lines 214-333):**

```cpp
void Brain::step(SimulationStep currentStep, Timestamp currentTime) {
    // 1. Process pending delayed spikes (deliver synaptic input) ✅
    pImpl->spikeSystem->processDelayedSpikes(currentStep, currentTime);
    
    // 2. Update all neurons (LIF dynamics) ✅
    for (auto& region : pImpl->regions) {
        for (auto& pop : region->getPopulations()) {
            for (auto* neuron : pop->getNeurons()) {
                neuron->stepLIF(currentTime, pImpl->timestep);
            }
        }
    }
    
    // 3. Detect spikes and schedule spike events ✅
    // ... spike detection and scheduling ...
    
    // 4. Apply plasticity rules (STDP and Hebbian) ✅
    for (auto& region : pImpl->regions) {
        for (auto& syn : region->getSynapses()) {
            // STDP and Hebbian applied
        }
    }
    
    // 5. Apply structural plasticity periodically (every 100 steps) ✅
    if (currentStep % 100 == 0) {
        pImpl->structuralPlasticity->update(this, *pImpl->rng);
    }
}
```

**What's NOT called in step():**
- ❌ Working memory update
- ❌ Episodic memory storage
- ❌ Prediction system update
- ❌ Attention update
- ❌ Concept formation
- ❌ Planning
- ❌ Development update (beyond structural plasticity)
- ❌ Neuromodulation update (dopamine, etc.)

| SimpleWorld | ✅ Working | ✅ Used in AgentBrain |
| SensoryPercept | ✅ Working | ✅ Used in AgentBrain |
| AgentBody | ✅ Defined | ⚠️ Limited integration |
| Motor commands | ✅ Working | ✅ Used in AgentBrain |

**Agent - World Loop:**
```cpp
// In experiment/demos:
while (running) {
    // 1. Get observation from world ✅
    SensoryPercept percept = world.observe(agent);
    
    // 2. Process sensory input ✅
    agentBrain.processSensoryInput(percept);
    
    // 3. Brain step ✅

    float reward = world.computeReward(agent);
    
    // 7. Apply reward modulation ✅
    agentBrain.applyRewardModulation(reward, predictedReward);
}
```

**What's missing after the loop:**
- No memory storage of experiences
- No prediction training
- No concept formation from observations
- No planning integration
- No sleep/rest cycle

## Conclusion

NLM/熙然 has a sophisticated **architecture** but functions as a **basic neural simulator** rather than an integrated artificial brain. The components exist but they don't interact. Phase 6 must focus on **integration over new features**.

**The primary goal of Phase 6 is to make the existing systems work together as a coherent whole, not to add more disconnected components.**
