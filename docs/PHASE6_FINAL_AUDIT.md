    return false;
}
bool Brain::load(const std::string& filepath) {
    NLM_LOG_INFO("Loading brain state from " + filepath + " (not implemented)");
    return false;
}
```

### 1.2 Agent Brain (Integration Layer) - STATUS: PARTIALLY INTEGRATED

**Location:** `src/agent/AgentBrain.hpp`, `src/agent/AgentBrain.cpp`

| Component | Status | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| Sensory processing | ✅ WORKING | Vision, touch, internal, proprioception |
| Motor decoding | ✅ WORKING | Activity-based action selection |

- Reward modulation directly accesses synapses but doesn't integrate with memory

### 1.3 Memory Systems - STATUS: DISCONNECTED PLACEHOLDERS

**Location:** `src/memory/Memory.hpp`, `src/memory/NeuralWorkingMemory.hpp`

| Memory Type | Header Status | Implementation Status | Integration |
|-------------|--------------|----------------------|-------------|

| Episodic Memory | ✅ Defined | ⚠️ Basic struct only | ❌ Not used |
| Semantic Memory | ✅ Defined | ❌ Empty implementation | ❌ Not used |
| Procedural Memory | ✅ Defined | ❌ Empty implementation | ❌ Not used |
| Associative Memory | ✅ Defined | ❌ Empty implementation | ❌ Not used |
| Attentional Selection | ✅ Defined | ⚠️ Partial | ❌ Not used |

**NeuralWorkingMemory Analysis:**
- Has proper mechanisms: persistent activity, recurrent connections, competition
- But `Brain::getWorkingMemory()` returns nullptr
- Never updated in brain loop
- No integration with sensory input or action selection

### 1.4 Neuromodulation - STATUS: PARTIAL INTEGRATION

**Location:** `src/neuromodulation/`

**Issues:**
- Dopamine only modulates STDP weight scaling (lines 465-466 in Brain.cpp)
- AgentBrain.applyRewardModulation() directly modifies synapses
- No connection between dopamine and memory consolidation
- No connection between ACh and attention
- No connection between NE and arousal

### 1.5 Cognition Systems - STATUS: DISCONNECTED

**Location:** `src/cognition/`

| Component | Status | Integration |
|-----------|--------|-------------|
| Next state prediction | ✅ Implemented | ❌ Not used |

**Issues:**
- Development modifies structural plasticity rates but doesn't affect:
  - Neural excitability
  - Plasticity rules themselves
  - Attention
  - Memory consolidation
  - Neuromodulation levels

### 1.8 Performance Infrastructure - STATUS: IMPLEMENTED

**Location:** `src/performance/`

| Component | Status | Integration |

    ↓
??? (gap - no prediction integration)
    ↓
??? (gap - no concept formation integration)
    ↓

**What's Missing:**

5. Planning → Action selection
6. Action → Self-model update
7. Self-model → Agency
8. Experience → Episodic memory
9. Episodic memory → Consolidation
10. Sleep/rest cycle → Memory consolidation

---

## 3. Main Brain Loop Analysis

**Current Brain::step() execution (lines 214-333):**

```cpp
void Brain::step(SimulationStep currentStep, Timestamp currentTime) {
    // 1. Process pending delayed spikes (deliver synaptic input) ✅
    pImpl->spikeSystem->processDelayedSpikes(currentStep, currentTime);
    
    // 2. Update all neurons (LIF dynamics) ✅
    for (auto& region : pImpl->regions) {
        for (auto& pop : region->getPopulations()) {
            for (auto* neuron : pop->getNeurons()) {
                neuron->stepLIF(currentTime, pImpl->timestep);
            }
        }
    }
    
    // 3. Detect spikes and schedule spike events ✅
    // ... spike detection and scheduling ...
    
    // 4. Apply plasticity rules (STDP and Hebbian) ✅
    for (auto& region : pImpl->regions) {
        for (auto& syn : region->getSynapses()) {
            // STDP and Hebbian applied
        }
    }
    
    // 5. Apply structural plasticity periodically (every 100 steps) ✅
    if (currentStep % 100 == 0) {
        pImpl->structuralPlasticity->update(this, *pImpl->rng);
    }
}
```

**What's NOT called in step():**
- ❌ Working memory update
- ❌ Episodic memory storage
- ❌ Prediction system update
- ❌ Attention update
- ❌ Concept formation
- ❌ Planning
- ❌ Development update (beyond structural plasticity)
- ❌ Neuromodulation update (dopamine, etc.)
- ❌ Memory consolidation
- ❌ Replay

## 4. Environment and Agent Integration

**Location:** `src/world/SimpleWorld.hpp`, `src/agent/`

| Component | Status | Integration |
|-----------|--------|-------------|
| SimpleWorld | ✅ Working | ✅ Used in AgentBrain |
| SensoryPercept | ✅ Working | ✅ Used in AgentBrain |
| AgentBody | ✅ Defined | ⚠️ Limited integration |
| Motor commands | ✅ Working | ✅ Used in AgentBrain |

**Agent - World Loop:**
```cpp
// In experiment/demos:
while (running) {
    // 1. Get observation from world ✅
    SensoryPercept percept = world.observe(agent);
    
    // 2. Process sensory input ✅
    agentBrain.processSensoryInput(percept);
    
    // 3. Brain step ✅
    brain.step(step);
    
    // 4. Decode motor command ✅
    MotorCommand cmd = agentBrain.decodeMotorCommand();
    
    // 5. Apply action to world ✅
    world.applyAction(agent, cmd);
    
    // 6. Compute reward ✅
    float reward = world.computeReward(agent);
    
    // 7. Apply reward modulation ✅
    agentBrain.applyRewardModulation(reward, predictedReward);
}
```

**What's missing after the loop:**
- No memory storage of experiences
- No prediction training
- No concept formation from observations
- No planning integration
- No sleep/rest cycle

| Metrics collection | ✅ Working | ✅ Used |
| Ablation system | ✅ Implemented | ❌ Not used in main experiments |

## Conclusion

NLM/熙然 has a sophisticated **architecture** but functions as a **basic neural simulator** rather than an integrated artificial brain. The components exist but they don't interact. Phase 6 must focus on **integration over new features**.

**The primary goal of Phase 6 is to make the existing systems work together as a coherent whole, not to add more disconnected components.**
