# NLM - Easy Usage Guide for Beginners

## What is NLM?

NLM is a **brain simulator** for computers. It lets you create virtual brains that can learn, remember things, and make decisions - just like how your brain works!

Think of it like this:
- **Neurons** = Brain cells that send signals to each other
- **Synapses** = Connections between brain cells  
- **Learning** = When connections get stronger or weaker based on what happens
- **Memory** = The brain remembering patterns
- **Prediction** = The brain predicting what will happen next
- **Concepts** = The brain discovering patterns and categorizing experiences
- **Development** = The brain maturing and changing over time
- **Neuromodulation** = The brain's chemical signals that control attention, reward, and exploration

That's it! NLM simulates all of this with a fully integrated brain architecture.

## The 3 Things You Need to Know

1. **Brain** - The virtual brain that thinks
2. **World** - The environment the brain lives in
3. **Agent** - The bridge connecting brain to world

## Quick Start (Copy & Paste)

### Example 1: Simplest Brain

```python
import pynlm

# Step 1: Make a brain
brain = pynlm.createBrain(pynlm.createDefaultConfig())

# Step 2: Turn it on
brain.initialize()

# Step 3: Make it think for 100 steps
for i in range(100):
    brain.step(i)  # One step of thinking

print("Done! Your brain thought", brain.getTotalSpikeCount(), "times")
```

### Example 2: Brain in a Simple World

```python
import pynlm

# Create everything
brain = pynlm.createBrain(pynlm.createDefaultConfig())
brain.initialize()

world = pynlm.createSimpleWorld()
world.configure(width=10, height=10, visionWidth=8, visionHeight=8)
world.reset()

agent = pynlm.createAgentBrain(brain)
agent.initialize(world)

# Run for 50 steps
for step in range(50):
    world.update(0.1)  # Update world
    percept = world.getSensoryPercept()  # What does the agent see?
    agent.processSensoryInput(percept)  # Brain sees it
    brain.step(step)  # Brain thinks
    action = agent.decodeMotorCommand()  # Brain decides action
    world.applyMotorCommand(action, world.getSimulationTime())  # Do action

print("Simulation finished!")
print("Firing neurons:", brain.getFiringNeuronCount())
```

### Example 2.5: Learning with Neuromodulation and Development

```python
import pynlm

# Setup
brain = pynlm.createBrain(pynlm.createDefaultConfig())
brain.initialize()
world = pynlm.createSimpleWorld()
world.configure(width=20, height=20, visionWidth=8, visionHeight=8)
world.reset()
agent = pynlm.createAgentBrain(brain)
agent.initialize(world)

# Enable learning and development
agent.enableRewardModulation(True)      # Learn from rewards
agent.enableCuriosity(True)              # Explore new things
agent.enableDevelopment(True)           # Brain matures over time
agent.enableStructuralPlasticity(True)  # Grow new connections

# Run learning simulation
for step in range(200):
    world.update(0.1)
    percept = world.getSensoryPercept()
    agent.processSensoryInput(percept)
    brain.step(step)
    action = agent.decodeMotorCommand()
    world.applyMotorCommand(action, world.getSimulationTime())
    
    # Simulate reward for exploring
    if step % 20 == 0:
        world = pynlm.createSimpleWorld()
        world.configure(width=15, height=15, visionWidth=8, visionHeight=8)
        world.reset()

print("Learning simulation complete!")
print("Firing rate:", brain.getAverageFiringRate())
print("Development stage:", brain.getDevelopmentalStage())
print("Neuromodulation level:", agent.getNeuromodulationLevel())
print("Curiosity level:", agent.getCuriosityLevel())
```

## Simple Analogy

| Real World | NLM Code |
|------------|----------|
| You see something | `percept = world.getSensoryPercept()` |
| Your brain processes it | `agent.processSensoryInput(percept)` |
| You decide to act | `action = agent.decodeMotorCommand()` |
| You do the action | `world.applyMotorCommand(action, time)` |
| Your brain learns from results | `agent.applyRewardModulation(reward, predicted)` |

---

## The Simplest Possible Example

```python
import pynlm

# One line to create a virtual brain
brain = pynlm.createBrain(pynlm.createDefaultConfig())

# Initialize it
brain.initialize()

# Make it active
brain.step(0)

print("Your brain has", brain.getTotalNeuronCount(), "neurons!")
```

## Common Patterns

### Pattern 1: Run a Simulation

```python
def run_simulation(brain, world, agent, num_steps):
    for step in range(num_steps):
        # 1. Update world
        world.update(0.1)
        
        # 2. Get what the agent sees
        percept = world.getSensoryPercept()
        
        # 3. Tell the brain
        agent.processSensoryInput(percept)
        
        # 4. Brain thinks
        brain.step(step)
        
        # 5. Get action from brain
        action = agent.decodeMotorCommand()
        
        # 6. Do action in world
        world.applyMotorCommand(action, world.getSimulationTime())

# Use it like this:
run_simulation(brain, world, agent, 1000)
```

### Pattern 2: Get Brain Stats

```python
# Just add these inside your loop:
print("Neurons firing:", brain.getFiringNeuronCount())
print("Total spikes:", brain.getTotalSpikeCount())
print("Avg firing rate:", brain.getAverageFiringRate())
print("Development stage:", brain.getDevelopmentalStage())
```

### Pattern 3: Enable Brain Features

```python
# These are all optional:
agent.enableRewardModulation(True)      # Learn from rewards
agent.enableStructuralPlasticity(True)  # Grow new connections
agent.enableDevelopment(True)           # Brain matures over time
agent.enableCuriosity(True)             # Explore new things
```

## What Each Part Does

### `pynlm.createBrain(config)`
Creates a virtual brain with neurons and synapses.
- `config` = settings for the brain (use `createDefaultConfig()` for simple setup)

### `brain.initialize()`
Starts up the brain. Always call this before using the brain!

### `brain.step(step_number)`
Makes the brain process one moment in time. The integrated brain performs:
- Checks each neuron
- Sends signals between connected neurons
- Updates connections based on learning rules
- Updates working memory (maintenance and competition)
- Applies neuromodulation effects on neural excitability
- Applies plasticity rules (STDP, Hebbian)
- Updates episodic memory with current experience
- Updates prediction system with neural-based predictions
- Updates attention system for focus selection
- Updates concept formation with prediction error integration
- Applies structural plasticity (synaptogenesis, pruning)
- Replays important memories (during rest or periodically)
- Applies development effects (brain maturation)
- Manages memory consolidation

### `world.update(time)`
Updates the virtual world by `time` seconds.

### `agent.processSensoryInput(percept)`
Gives sensory information (vision, touch, etc.) to the brain.

### `agent.decodeMotorCommand()`
Reads the brain's motor neurons to decide what action to take.

world.reset()
agent = pynlm.createAgentBrain(brain)
agent.initialize(world)

# Watch the world for 30 steps
for i in range(30):

        print(f"  Concepts formed: {brain.getConceptFormation() ? brain.getConceptFormation()->getConceptCount() : 0}")

print("Advanced brain simulation complete!")
```

## Quick Reference

| What you want | Code |
|--------------|------|
| Create brain | `pynlm.createBrain(config)` |
| Start brain | `brain.initialize()` |
| Make brain think | `brain.step(step)` |
| Create world | `pynlm.createSimpleWorld()` |

## Troubleshooting

**"My brain isn't doing anything"**
- Did you call `brain.initialize()`?
- Try increasing the number of steps

**"The agent isn't moving"**
- Did you call `world.applyMotorCommand()`?
- Check that `world.update()` is being called

**"Everything is 0"**
- Brains need time to "warm up" - try more steps
- Some neurons need input to fire - make sure sensory input is connected
