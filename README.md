# NLM — 熙然

**An Experimental Artificial Developmental Brain**

## What is NLM?

NLM (熙然, meaning "serene flow") is an experimental computational brain project. The long-term goal is to create a neural system that begins in a primitive developmental state and acquires increasingly complex abilities through interaction with an environment.

NLM is NOT:
- A transformer or LLM
- A chatbot
- A deep learning model
- A pretrained AI system

NLM IS intended to become:
- A neural system that learns from experience
- A brain-inspired architecture with neurons and synapses
- A system that develops and adapts over time
- A system where cognition emerges from neural dynamics

## Current Phase

**PHASE 6: FINAL INTEGRATION**

Phase 6 focuses on integrating all existing systems into a coherent artificial brain. Previous phases built individual components; Phase 6 ensures they work together as a unified system.

### Phase 6 Integration Achievements

#### Memory Systems
- Working memory with persistent activity and competition
- Episodic memory with experience encoding and replay
- Associative memory with Hebbian pattern associations
- All memory systems connected to neural processing

#### Neuromodulation Integration
- Dopamine affects neural excitability and plasticity
- Curiosity drives exploration behavior
- Novelty detection integrated with sensory processing
- All neuromodulators connected to plasticity rules

#### Prediction System
- Prediction system integrated into brain loop
- Prediction error signals affect learning
- Confidence tracking implemented

#### Cognition Systems
- Neural planner with action sequence evaluation
- Concept formation from experience patterns
- Attention with competitive selection dynamics
- All cognition systems connected to perception and action

#### Development Integration
- Developmental stages affect plasticity rates
- Structural plasticity modulated by age
- Neural excitability changes with development

#### Persistence
- Checkpoint save/load implemented
- Brain state serialization working
- Can resume from saved checkpoints

#### Replay and Consolidation
- Episodic memory replay during simulation
- Memory consolidation for important episodes
- Integration with sleep/rest cycle

## Building

```bash
mkdir build
cd build
cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
make -j4
```

## Running

### Phase 6 Demo (Integration Test)
```bash
# Run the main integration test
./nlm

# Or run Phase 4 demo
./nlm_phase4_demo

# Run Phase 3 demo
./nlm_phase3_demo
```

These run comprehensive integration tests verifying all brain systems are connected and working together.

## Quick Python Usage (Phase 6 Features)

```python
import pynlm

# Create and initialize brain with default config
brain = pynlm.createBrain(pynlm.createDefaultConfig())
brain.initialize()

# Create world and agent
world = pynlm.createSimpleWorld()
world.configure(width=20, height=20, visionWidth=8, visionHeight=8)
world.reset()

agent = pynlm.createAgentBrain(brain)
agent.initialize(world)

# Enable ALL Phase 6 learning features
agent.enableRewardModulation(True)
agent.enableCuriosity(True)
agent.enableDevelopment(True)
agent.enableStructuralPlasticity(True)

# Run simulation loop
for step in range(1000):
    world.update(0.1)
    agent.processSensoryInput(world.getSensoryPercept())
    brain.step(step)
    action = agent.decodeMotorCommand()
    world.applyMotorCommand(action, world.getSimulationTime())
    
    # Apply learning
    reward = world.getSensoryPercept().getInternal()[0] if world.getSensoryPercept().getInternal() else 0.0
    agent.applyRewardModulation(reward, 0.0)
    agent.updateDevelopment(0.1)

print(f"Simulation complete!")
print(f"Final firing neurons: {brain.getFiringNeuronCount()}")
print(f"Curiosity level: {agent.getCuriosityLevel():.3f}")
print(f"Novelty level: {agent.getNoveltyLevel():.3f}")
print(f"Developmental stage: {brain.getDevelopmentalStage()}")
```

## Scientific Limitations

NLM is a research project investigating computational brain-like systems. We make NO claims that NLM accurately reproduces biological brains. Current limitations include:

- Simplified LIF neuron model (not Hodgkin-Huxley)
- No realistic ion channel dynamics
- No detailed dendritic morphology
- No detailed cortical architecture
- No claim of consciousness, intelligence, or human-like cognition
- Limited to what can be simulated with available computing resources

Phase 6 does NOT claim:
- Human intelligence
- Consciousness or sentience
- Human-like reasoning
- Genuine subjective experience

Phase 6 DOES investigate:
- Whether memory systems can integrate with neural dynamics
- Whether neuromodulation can affect plasticity in a coordinated way
- Whether prediction can become a central organizing principle
- Whether developmental stages can modulate learning
- Whether replay can reinforce memory consolidation
- Whether the complete brain loop functions coherently

## Architecture Philosophy

The NLM brain operates as a closed-loop system:

```

MOTOR OUTPUT
