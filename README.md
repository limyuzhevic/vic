# NLM — 熙然

**An Experimental Artificial Developmental Brain**

## What is NLM?

NLM (熙然, meaning "serene flow") is an experimental computational brain project. The long-term goal is to create a neural system that begins in a primitive developmental state and acquires increasingly complex abilities through interaction with an environment.

NLM is NOT:
- A transformer or LLM
- A chatbot
- A deep learning model
- A pretrained AI system

NLM IS intended to become:
- A neural system that learns from experience
- A brain-inspired architecture with neurons and synapses
- A system that develops and adapts over time
- A system where cognition emerges from neural dynamics

## Current Phase

**PHASE 6: FINAL INTEGRATION**

Phase 6 focuses on integrating all existing systems into a coherent artificial brain. Previous phases built individual components; Phase 6 ensures they work together as a unified system.

### Phase 6 Integration Achievements

#### Memory Systems
- Working memory with persistent activity and competition
- Episodic memory with experience encoding and replay
- Associative memory with Hebbian pattern associations
- All memory systems connected to neural processing

#### Neuromodulation Integration
- Dopamine affects neural excitability and plasticity
- Curiosity drives exploration behavior
- Novelty detection integrated with sensory processing
- All neuromodulators connected to plasticity rules

#### Prediction System
- Prediction system integrated into brain loop
- Prediction error signals affect learning
- Confidence tracking implemented

#### Cognition Systems
- Neural planner with action sequence evaluation
- Concept formation from experience patterns
- Attention with competitive selection dynamics
- All cognition systems connected to perception and action

#### Development Integration
- Developmental stages affect plasticity rates
- Structural plasticity modulated by age
- Neural excitability changes with development

#### Persistence
- Checkpoint save/load implemented
- Brain state serialization working
- Can resume from saved checkpoints

#### Replay and Consolidation
- Episodic memory replay during simulation
- Memory consolidation for important episodes
- Integration with sleep/rest cycle

## Building

```bash
mkdir build
cd build
cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
make -j4
```

## Running

### Phase 6 Demo (Integration Test)
```bash
./nlm_phase6_demo
```

This runs a comprehensive integration test verifying all brain systems are connected.

### Python Integration

### Installation

From source (Recommended for Development):

```bash
# Install build dependencies
pip install pybind11 scikit-build-core pytest numpy

# Build and install the Python bindings
pip install -e .

# Or build only (without installing)
pip install build
python -m build

# Install from wheel
pip install dist/*.whl
```

### Basic Usage

```python
import pynlm

# Create a brain with default configuration
config = pynlm.createDefaultConfig()
brain = pynlm.createBrain(config)
brain.initialize()

# Run simulation
for step in range(1000):
    brain.step(step)
    if step % 100 == 0:
        print(f"Step {step}: {brain.getFiringNeuronCount()} firing neurons")

print(f"Simulation complete! Total spikes: {brain.getTotalSpikeCount()}")
```

### Creating a Complete Agent

```python
import pynlm

# Create brain and initialize
brain = pynlm.createBrain(pynlm.createDefaultConfig())
brain.initialize()

# Create world and agent
world = pynlm.createSimpleWorld()
world.configure(width=20, height=20, visionWidth=8, visionHeight=8)
world.reset()

agent = pynlm.createAgentBrain(brain)
agent.initialize(world)

# Enable learning and development features
agent.enableRewardModulation(True)
agent.enableStructuralPlasticity(True)
agent.enableDevelopment(True)
agent.enableCuriosity(True)

# Run complete agent simulation
for step in range(1000):
    world.update(0.1)
    percept = world.getSensoryPercept()
    agent.processSensoryInput(percept)
    brain.step(step)
    action = agent.decodeMotorCommand()
    world.applyMotorCommand(action, world.getSimulationTime())
    
    # Get reward and apply neuromodulation
    reward = world.getSensoryPercept().getInternal()[0] if world.getSensoryPercept().getInternal() else 0.0
    agent.applyRewardModulation(reward, 0.0)
    agent.updateDevelopment(0.1)

print(f"Agent simulation complete!")
print(f"Final curiosity: {agent.getCuriosityLevel():.3f}")
print(f"Firing neurons: {brain.getFiringNeuronCount()}")
```

### Advanced Configuration

```python
def create_advanced_brain(neuron_count=1000, learning_rate=0.01):
    """Create a brain with advanced configuration."""
    config = pynlm.createDefaultConfig()
    
    # Configure advanced parameters
    config.set("brain.neuron_count", neuron_count)
    config.set("plasticity.stdp.learning_rate", learning_rate)
    config.set("plasticity.hebbian.enable", True)
    config.set("plasticity.structural.enable", True)
    
    # Create brain and agent
    brain = pynlm.createBrain(config)
    brain.initialize()
    
    world = pynlm.createSimpleWorld()
    world.configure(width=20, height=20, visionWidth=8, visionHeight=8)
    world.reset()
    
    agent = pynlm.createAgentBrain(brain)
    agent.initialize(world)
    
    # Enable all features
    agent.enableRewardModulation(True)
    agent.enableStructuralPlasticity(True)
    agent.enableDevelopment(True)
    agent.enableCuriosity(True)
    
    return brain, agent, world
```

## Scientific Limitations

NLM is a research project investigating computational brain-like systems. We make NO claims that NLM accurately reproduces biological brains. Current limitations include:

- Simplified LIF neuron model (not Hodgkin-Huxley)
- No realistic ion channel dynamics
- No detailed dendritic morphology
- No detailed cortical architecture
- No claim of consciousness, intelligence, or human-like cognition
- Limited to what can be simulated with available computing resources

Phase 6 does NOT claim:
- Human intelligence
- Consciousness or sentience
- Human-like reasoning
- Genuine subjective experience

Phase 6 DOES investigate:
- Whether memory systems can integrate with neural dynamics
- Whether neuromodulation can affect plasticity in a coordinated way
- Whether prediction can become a central organizing principle
- Whether developmental stages can modulate learning
- Whether replay can reinforce memory consolidation
- Whether the complete brain loop functions coherently

## Architecture Philosophy

The NLM brain operates as a closed-loop system:

```
WORLD
  ↓
SENSORY INPUT
  ↓
NEURAL PROCESSING (LIF dynamics, spikes)
  ↓
INTERNAL STATE (working memory, attention)
  ↓
MEMORY / PREDICTION
  ↓
MOTIVATION / NEUROMODULATION (dopamine, curiosity)
  ↓
ACTION SELECTION
  ↓
MOTOR OUTPUT
  ↓
WORLD CONSEQUENCE
  ↓
REWARD / SURPRISE / ERROR
  ↓
PLASTICITY (STDP, Hebbian, structural)
  ↓
MEMORY / DEVELOPMENT
  ↓
CHANGED BRAIN
  ↓
CHANGED FUTURE BEHAVIOR
