# NLM — 熙然

**An Experimental Artificial Developmental Brain**

## What is NLM?

NLM (熙然, meaning "serene flow") is an experimental computational brain project. The long-term goal is to create a neural system that begins in a primitive developmental state and acquires increasingly complex abilities through interaction with an environment.

NLM is NOT:
- A transformer or LLM
- A chatbot
- A deep learning model
- A pretrained AI system

NLM IS intended to become:
- A neural system that learns from experience
- A brain-inspired architecture with neurons and synapses
- A system that develops and adapts over time
- A system where cognition emerges from neural dynamics

## Current Phase

**PHASE 2: REAL NEURAL COMPUTATION**

The main NLM executable (`./nlm`) implements Phase 2: Real Neural Computation. This phase implements real spiking neural computation with:

### Phase 2 Implementation

#### Core Neural Computation
- **Real LIF neuron dynamics**: Leaky Integrate-and-Fire neurons with real biophysical properties
- **Event-driven spike propagation**: Spikes propagate with synaptic delays in real-time
- **STDP and Hebbian plasticity**: Activity-dependent synaptic modification rules
- **Structural plasticity**: Synaptogenesis and pruning based on activity

#### Learning Experiments
- **Plasticity Learning Experiment**: Demonstrates measurable synaptic changes through experience
- **STDP Verification**: Tests spike-timing dependent plasticity with pre-before-post correlation
- **Basic Connectivity Test**: Verifies neural network connectivity and spike propagation

## Building

```bash
mkdir build
cd build
cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
make -j4
```

## Running

### Main NLM Executable (Phase 2)
```bash
./nlm
```

This runs the Phase 2 real neural computation tests:
1. Basic neural connectivity test
2. Plasticity learning experiment with STDP and Hebbian learning
3. STDP verification experiment

### Advanced Demos (Available)

The project also includes Phase 3 and Phase 4 demo executables that build on the core Phase 2 neural computation:

```bash
# Phase 3: World interaction loop
./nlm_phase3_demo

# Phase 4: Advanced cognitive systems
./nlm_phase4_demo
```

These demos integrate additional systems like world interaction, memory, prediction, and cognition onto the neural foundation established in Phase 2.

## Scientific Limitations

NLM is a research project investigating computational brain-like systems. We make NO claims that NLM accurately reproduces biological brains. Current limitations include:

- Simplified LIF neuron model (not Hodgkin-Huxley)
- No realistic ion channel dynamics
- No detailed dendritic morphology
- No detailed cortical architecture
- No claim of consciousness, intelligence, or human-like cognition
- Limited to what can be simulated with available computing resources

Phase 6 does NOT claim:
- Human intelligence
- Consciousness or sentience
- Human-like reasoning
- Genuine subjective experience

Phase 6 DOES investigate:
- Whether memory systems can integrate with neural dynamics
- Whether neuromodulation can affect plasticity in a coordinated way
- Whether prediction can become a central organizing principle
- Whether developmental stages can modulate learning
- Whether replay can reinforce memory consolidation
- Whether the complete brain loop functions coherently

## Architecture Philosophy

The NLM brain operates as a closed-loop system:

```
