# NLM — 熙然

**An Experimental Artificial Developmental Brain**

## What is NLM?

NLM (熙然, meaning "serene flow") is an experimental computational brain project. The long-term goal is to create a neural system that begins in a primitive developmental state and acquires increasingly complex abilities through interaction with an environment.

NLM is NOT:
- A transformer or LLM
- A chatbot
- A deep learning model
- A pretrained AI system

NLM IS intended to become:
- A neural system that learns from experience
- A brain-inspired architecture with neurons and synapses
- A system that develops and adapts over time
- A system where cognition emerges from neural dynamics

## Current status (honest, 2026-10-31)

Phase 1 made the repo build again. Phase 2 made the brain real at the
substrate level: populations now actually create neurons, random
connectivity creates ~37k synapses for a 500-neuron brain (was 0),
spikes propagate (Test 1: ~8k spikes, Test 2: ~199k spikes over 1000
steps), and a controlled STDP test potentiates its synapse
(0.35 -> 0.99). Inhibitory neurons now exist (20% of internal
population) and inhibitory plasticity keeps its sign instead of
flipping to excitatory.

Still not a working brain in the behavioural sense: Phase 3 and Phase 6
demos still report 0 reward, and checkpointing does not work (it is a
stub that honestly returns false). Activity is still very high
(~200 spikes/step) and learning in the main demo is mostly
saturation, not selective pattern learning. Those are the next
problems, not hidden ones.

## Current Phase

**PHASE 6: FINAL INTEGRATION**

Phase 6 focuses on integrating all existing systems into a coherent artificial brain. Previous phases built individual components; Phase 6 ensures they work together as a unified system.

#### Python Usage (Recommended for research and prototyping)

```python
import pynlm

# Create a brain with custom configuration
config = pynlm.createDefaultConfig()
config.set("brain.neuron_count", 1000)
config.set("plasticity.stdp.enable", True)
config.set("plasticity.hebbian.enable", True)

# Initialize brain
brain = pynlm.createBrain(config)
brain.initialize()

# Run simulation
for step in range(1000):
    brain.step(step)
    if step % 100 == 0:
        print(f"Step {step}: {brain.getFiringNeuronCount()} neurons firing")

# Save brain state for checkpointing
brain.save("my_brain_checkpoint.bin")
```

### Quick Demo Scripts

Create `quick_start.py` for beginners:

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
"""
Quick start guide for NLM Python usage.
Run: python3 quick_start.py
"""
import pynlm

print("=== NLM Quick Start ===")
print("1. Creating brain with default settings...")
config = pynlm.createDefaultConfig()
brain = pynlm.createBrain(config)
brain.initialize()

print(f"2. Brain created with {brain.getTotalNeuronCount()} neurons")
print(f"   and {brain.getTotalSynapseCount()} synapses")

print("3. Running simulation...")
for step in range(100):
    brain.step(step)

print("4. Simulation complete!")
print(f"   Final firing rate: {brain.getAverageFiringRate():.2f} Hz")
print(f"   Total spikes: {brain.getTotalSpikeCount()}")
```

Make it executable: `chmod +x quick_start.py` and run: `python3 quick_start.py`

## Scientific Limitations

NLM is a research project investigating computational brain-like systems. We make NO claims that NLM accurately reproduces biological brains. Current limitations include:

- Simplified LIF neuron model (not Hodgkin-Huxley)
- No realistic ion channel dynamics
- No detailed dendritic morphology
- No detailed cortical architecture
- No claim of consciousness, intelligence, or human-like cognition
- Limited to what can be simulated with available computing resources

Phase 6 does NOT claim:
- Human intelligence
- Consciousness or sentience
- Human-like reasoning
- Genuine subjective experience

Phase 6 DOES investigate:
- Whether memory systems can integrate with neural dynamics
- Whether neuromodulation can affect plasticity in a coordinated way
- Whether prediction can become a central organizing principle
- Whether developmental stages can modulate learning
- Whether replay can reinforce memory consolidation
- Whether the complete brain loop functions coherently

## Architecture Philosophy

The NLM brain operates as a closed-loop system:
