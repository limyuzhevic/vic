# NLM — 熙然

**An Experimental Artificial Developmental Brain**

## What is NLM?

NLM (熙然, meaning "serene flow") is an experimental computational brain project. The long-term goal is to create a neural system that begins in a primitive developmental state and acquires increasingly complex abilities through interaction with an environment.

NLM is NOT:
- A transformer or LLM
- A chatbot
- A deep learning model
- A pretrained AI system

NLM IS intended to become:
- A neural system that learns from experience
- A brain-inspired architecture with neurons and synapses
- A system that develops and adapts over time
- A system where cognition emerges from neural dynamics

## Current Phase

**PHASE 2: Real Neural Computation**

Phase 2 implements real spiking neural computation with:
- Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (LIF) neurons
- Event-driven spike propagation with synaptic delays
- STDP and Hebbian plasticity
- Structural plasticity (synaptogenesis/pruning)

### Phase 6 Integration Achievements

#### Memory Systems
- Working memory with persistent activity and competition
- Episodic memory with experience encoding and replay
- Associative memory with Hebbian pattern associations
- All memory systems connected to neural processing

#### Neuromodulation Integration
- Dopamine affects neural excitability and plasticity
- Curiosity drives exploration behavior
- Novelty detection integrated with sensory processing
- All neuromodulators connected to plasticity rules

#### Prediction System
- Prediction system integrated into brain loop
- Prediction error signals affect learning
- Confidence tracking implemented

#### Cognition Systems
- Neural planner with action sequence evaluation
- Concept formation from experience patterns
- Attention with competitive selection dynamics
- All cognition systems connected to perception and action

#### Development Integration
- Developmental stages affect plasticity rates
- Structural plasticity modulated by age
- Neural excitability changes with development

#### Persistence
- Checkpoint save/load implemented
- Brain state serialization working
- Can resume from saved checkpoints

#### Replay and Consolidation
- Episodic memory replay during simulation
- Memory consolidation for important episodes
- Integration with sleep/rest cycle

## Building

```bash
mkdir build
cd build
cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
make -j4
```

## Running

### Phase 6 Demo (Integration Test)
```bash
./nlm_phase6_demo
```

This runs a comprehensive integration test verifying all brain systems are connected.
